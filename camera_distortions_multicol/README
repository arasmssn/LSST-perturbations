This directory contains camera surface multicolumn data in grid format. The 
data were extracted from the first 11 rows of FITS the following extensions 
contained in the output_fitstable.fits file:

L1_S1_distortion (extension index 6)
L2_S1_distortion (extension index 7)
L3_S1_distortion (extension index 8)
L1_S2_distortion (extension index 9)
L2_S2_distortion (extension index 10)
L3_S2_distortion (extension index 11)

The files were constructed by running LSST-perturbations/bo_tablegen.perl
which in turn repeatedly called LSST-perturbations/extract_from_fits.perl
and ingested & organized the output files that contained the extracted 
arrays.

The files contained here are the 12 files that are named:

L{1,2,3}_S{1,2}_distortion_{gravity,thermalsoak}.multicol

Formats for the multicol data are:

<X_ccs> <Y_ccs> <deltaZ_condition1> <deltaZ_condition2>..<deltaZ_conditionN>

where <X_ccs> and <Y_ccs> are the Camera Coordinate System lateral coordinates
for the FEA nodes, and deltaZ_condition1 is the axial (Z_ccs) displacement of 
that node according to the conditions that went into the rows of the binary
fits table extensions written above. Specifically,

for *gravity*

condition1 = zenith  (theta=0),  camera rot (phi=0),  soak temperature (T=NA)
condition2 = horizon (theta=90), camera rot (phi=0),  soak temperature (T=NA)
condition3 = horizon (theta=90), camera rot (phi=90), soak temperature (T=NA)

for *thermalsoak*

condition1 = zenith  (theta=NA), camera rot (phi=NA), soak temperature (T=-10)
condition2 = horizon (theta=NA), camera rot (phi=NA), soak temperature (T=-5)
condition3 = horizon (theta=NA), camera rot (phi=NA), soak temperature (T=0)
condition4 = horizon (theta=NA), camera rot (phi=NA), soak temperature (T=5)
condition5 = horizon (theta=NA), camera rot (phi=NA), soak temperature (T=10)
condition6 = horizon (theta=NA), camera rot (phi=NA), soak temperature (T=15)
condition7 = horizon (theta=NA), camera rot (phi=NA), soak temperature (T=20)
condition8 = horizon (theta=NA), camera rot (phi=NA), soak temperature (T=25)

Notice that the *thermalsoak* distortion data for L3 contains basically 
roundoff noise, because we don't have distortion data for that.

NB. All 5-DOF solidbody transformation data for each body (L1,L2,F,L3,FP)
are not extracted into this grid format. They are available as before in the 
first 11 rows of the tables in extensions 1 through 5.
